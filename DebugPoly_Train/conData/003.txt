A group of angry liberals are planning to stage multiple protests around the District of Columbia on Inauguration Day aimed at disrupting, and hopefully stopping, President-elect Donald Trump’s swearing in.

The group calls itself #DisruptJ20, and says it is comprised of a “collective of experienced local activists and out-of-work gravediggers.”

DisruptJ20 has already garnered the support of thousands of Americans, but says it is continuing to build the “framework needed for mass protests to shut down the inauguration of Donald Trump and planning widespread direct actions to make that happen.” Those looking to participate stand to gain “housing, food,” and even “legal assistance,” courtesy of the group should anything go awry.

It won’t all be yelling and fisticuffs, “because we like fun, we’re even going to throw some parties,” the group says.

DisruptJ20 touts the support of the DC Welcoming Committee, an LGBTQ movement that wants to experience the whole world, “and not just gay bars, in outrageous comfort.”

“We’re planning a series of massive direct actions that will shut down the Inauguration ceremonies and any related celebrations–the Inaugural parade, the Inaugural balls, you name it,” DisruptJ20 says on its website. The movement plans to not only protest, but to “paralyze the city itself, using blockades and marches to stop traffic and even public transit.”

The group’s protests and “blockades” will be built around banners like “racial justice,” “economic justice,” “climate justice,” “communities under attack,” and “anti-war and Palestine.”

While there has been no direct call for violence from DisruptJ20, some, like website Crimethinc.com, conjecture that these protests could erupt into violence.

“Some are calling for blockades at the checkpoints around the parade route, in hopes that Trump will ride into office in front of silent, empty bleachers,” Crimethinc writes. “Others are preparing to rove the city, supporting and defending other protesters and responding to situations as they arise.”

One D.C. think tank member reports finding an “indirect link” between the group and billionaire Clinton backer, George Soros, the Daily Signal reports.

Disrupt J20 has events starting as early as Jan. 14, and urge protesters to attend the “Action Camp” at American University to learn more about the movement. Events include “Racial Cheerleading,” “Know Your Rights,” and “How To Cop Watch,” among others.

The main event will be held in McPherson Square in downtown Washington, D.C., just blocks from the White House.
