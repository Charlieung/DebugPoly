LOS ANGELES—Immigrants and their supporters plan to hold rallies in 50 cities across the country Saturday in the first large-scale mobilization of immigrant-rights forces since the election of Donald Trump.
Organizers representing civil-rights, faith-based and immigrant groups said they have mobilized thousands of people from New York and Miami to Los Angeles and Phoenix.

They said Saturday’s “Day of Action” would kick off a new phase of activism in defiance of Mr. Trump’s incendiary rhetoric against Mexicans during his campaign and his pledge to crack down on illegal immigration.

“We are prepared to defend our dreams and our families, whatever comes,” said Ricardo Zamudio, an organizer at Neighborhood Ministries, a faith-based organization in Phoenix that has joined other groups for a rally in central Phoenix. “There is a lot at stake here.”

Activists will call on city mayors and local officials to protect immigrant communities, namely by adopting sanctuary policies. Several cities already have pledged to shield immigrants from federal immigration authorities.

Following Mr. Trump’s election, “there is a deep sense of fear and worry in immigrant communities, “said Christina Jimenez, executive director of United We Dream, a national organization. “At the same time, there is no way we will go back to living in the shadows,” she said.

Saturday’s coordinated rallies signal a new chapter in the immigrant-rights movement that was born in 2006. That year, more than one million people took to the streets to protest a bill that would have criminalized assistance to undocumented immigrants.

The bill proposed by U.S. Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R, Wis.) didn't pass the Senate. But Congress also failed to reach a compromise to overhaul the nation’s immigration system and address the fate of 11 million people living in the country unlawfully.

Newly empowered young undocumented immigrants used sit-ins, hunger strikes and lobbying to press President Barack Obama to take executive action to bring relief to those brought to the country illegally as children, known as Dreamers.

In response to their demands, Mr. Obama in 2012 launched DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which gives those who qualify for the program a reprieve from deportation and work permits, renewable every two years. Currently, 750,000 undocumented youngsters have DACA.

During his campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to eliminate any programs created through executive action, and his 10-point immigration plan, posted online, states the same.

But since his election, the president-elect has tempered his tone, saying he might consider other options for DACA beneficiaries.

Activists said that Saturday they would be rallying for Mr. Trump to preserve DACA.

“It is up to us to defend this huge victory,” said Oscar Hernandez, a DACA recipient in Houston, who is helping organize a rally there.


High-school senior Vanessa Quevedo, who arrived in the U.S. from Mexico when she was six years old, is among DACA beneficiaries sharing her personal journey during events in Denver.

“America is my home despite the fact that some people don’t see it as my home,” said Ms. Quevedo, who recently gained admission to Williams College in Massachusetts, where she plans to enroll next fall.

Buses will transport demonstrators from outlying areas to some rallies, such as in Salem, Oregon’s capital.

“This is an act of defiance,” said Phil Carrasco, president of Grupo Latino de Accion Direto, a nonprofit that is taking people from Eugene to the state capital. “We immigrants have the power to protect one another and our American dream.”
