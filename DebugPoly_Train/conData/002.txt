More than two months after the presidential election, elected Democrats and members of Hillary Clinton’s inner circle continue to question the legitimacy of Donald Trump’s electoral victory.

Among the latest Clinton insiders to do so was Brian Fallon, who was the press secretary on Hillary’s unsuccessful campaign. Asked on CNN’s “New Day” on Friday to respond to a series of Trump tweets hammering Clinton, Fallon claimed the “legitimacy” of Trump’s election is still in question.

Why Won't Hillary Clinton's Campaign Staffers Accept The Legitimacy Of The Election?
  Because It's Their Fault She Lost         Because The Election Really Was Illegitimate         Because They Are Simply Butt Hurt         To Improve Their Future Employment Prospects         None Of The Above

“I think those tweets are just the latest indication that Donald Trump is someone very insecure in his victory, and I understand why. Every day there are new developments and new shoes dropping, so to speak, that call into question the legitimacy of his win,” Fallon claimed.
“First it was with respect to Russian interference and they tried to deny, the Trump folks did, that Russia was behind this and now forced to admit that. Then they tried to say it was not for the purposes of trying to help Donald Trump, they were trying to sow confusion and targeting both sides and now folks in the government have concluded it was to tip the election Donald Trump’s way,” he continued.

“And now, with respect to the FBI, we see that Jim Comey’s actions are significantly questionable that the independent watchdog and the DOJ think they merit an independent review, so I think Donald Trump is is trying to cling to whatever legitimacy that is still in effect here.”


Democratic Georgia Rep. John Lewis, who had endorsed Clinton for president, also challenged Trump’s legitimacy on Friday, telling NBC News: “I don’t see Trump as a legitimate president.”

Fallon and Lewis are just the latest Democrats close to Clinton to try and undermine the legitimacy of Trump’s election. (RELATED: Journalists Exposed By WikiLeaks Will Now Cover Trump White House)

Heba Abedin, sister of longtime Hilary aide and confidant Huma Abedin, appeared to imply that the vote tallies had been tampered with in a Facebook post after the election, urging her followers to “audit” the election results. The reason for the audit, according to Heba, was that “there is something really off about the election results as they come in.”

The Clinton camp later signed on to recount efforts in a handful of states that turned out to be pointless, as they only delivered Clinton a handful of votes — nowhere near what she would have needed to overturn the election results.

It was later revealed that Hillary Clinton’s staffers quietly supported the “faithless elector” push to try and have the electoral college override the election outcome. Clinton ended up losing more electoral votes than Trump. (RELATED: White House, Clinton Tied To PR Firm Behind Electoral College Push)
